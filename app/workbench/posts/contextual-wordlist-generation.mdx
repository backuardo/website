## Overview

I've been spending time studying for CPTS and participating in bug bounties lately, and one thing that I keep questioning is the disconnect between the intelligence I gather during reconnaissance and the wordlists I actually use for attacks.

During reconnaissance, we gather target-specific intelligence: org names, technologies, personnel, geographic locations, internal project names, etc. But it's time-consuming to generate a comprehensive wordlist with this context, so we typically use an off-the-shelf wordlist.

Real organizations don't name their infrastructure using dictionary words. They use internal project names, geographic references, tech stacks, and naming conventions that come from years of tech debt and shortcuts.

## Improving the reconnaisance-to-exploitation gap
I'm building [Wordbender](https://github.com/backuardo/wordbender)—an experiment in using LLMs to generate contextual wordlists. The idea is simple: take the intelligence you've gathered about a target and let an LLM generate wordlists that actually understand that context.

As an example, imagine we're performing a penetration test on Tesla, and want to brute-force subdomains. We feed the following seed words into Wordbender:

```bash
Tesla, TSLA, Supercharger, Autopilot, Full Self-Driving, Powerwall, Solar Roof, Electric Vehicle, Python, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Tesla Operating System, over-the-air updates, AWS, Austin TX, Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Plaid, Ludicrous, Autopilot
```

And the output contains some promising-looking subdomains we can try:

```bash
api
autopilot
supercharger
tesla-api
model3
models
modelx
modely
cybertruck
autopilot-dev
fsd
fullselfdriving
powerwall
solar
api-v2
dev
staging
prod
test
admin
tesla-dev
tsla-api
supercharger-api
austin

tx-prod
aws-tesla

k8s-cluster

solar-api
powerwall-monitor
semi
roadster
plaid
ludicrous-mode
dev1
test-autopilot
staging-fsd
legacy-api
temp-prod
demo
tesla-internal
fleet
```

## What it generates

Right now Wordbender handles a few wordlist types, and I'll be adding more over the coming weeks.

**Password Base Words**: These aren't final passwords—they're the meaningful base words that people build passwords around. The LLM generates personally significant terms that Hashcat can then mutate with rules. Instead of hoping `rockyou.txt` has the right base words, you get terms actually relevant to your target.

**Subdomain Names**: Context-aware subdomain labels that reflect how organizations actually name their infrastructure: `dev-api`, `staging-auth`, `legacy-payments`. I run these first before falling back to generic subdomain lists.

**Directory/File Paths**: Web paths based on the target's technology stack and naming patterns. Again, these supplement rather than replace comprehensive directory lists—you run the targeted list first to catch the obvious hits.

**Cloud Resource Names**: Realistic S3 bucket names, storage accounts, etc. The LLM understands how developers actually name cloud resources (it's usually chaotic and predictable at the same time).

## Implementation

The architecture uses a factory pattern with automatic service discovery, making it easy to add new wordlist types or LLM providers. Currently supports Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4, and OpenRouter for model access.

Each wordlist type implements specific validation rules—DNS compliance for subdomains, character restrictions for passwords, length limits for cloud resources. The tool handles deduplication, filtering, and format validation automatically.

Multiple operation modes support different workflows:
- **Interactive mode** for exploratory testing
- **Direct generation** for scripted attacks: `wordbender generate subdomain -s tesla -s automotive -l 100`
- **Batch processing** for large-scale operations

## Does it work?

The results have been encouraging so far. The strategy is simple: run targeted wordlists first to grab the obvious hits, then fall back to comprehensive generic lists for broader coverage.

Admittedly, the biggest technical hurdle is crafting good prompts. So while this tool is already pretty helpful, I hope to improve it over the coming months as I get better at writing prompts.

## Trying it out

The tool is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/backuardo/wordbender) if you want to experiment with it. You'll need Python 3.8+ and an API key for one of the supported LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter). Alternatively, if your favorite provider isn't implemented yet, or you want to run a local model, it's easy to add a new provider (based on the `WordlistGenerator` abstract base class).

```bash
# Basic setup
git clone https://github.com/backuardo/wordbender
cd wordbender
uv sync
uv run wordbender.py config --setup

# Generate targeted base words, then feed to Hashcat
uv run wordbender.py generate password -s company -s product -l 200
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt password_base_wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule

# Targeted-then-comprehensive subdomain enumeration
uv run wordbender.py generate subdomain -s target -s technology -l 100
gobuster dns -d target.com -w subdomain_wordlist.txt
gobuster dns -d target.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
```

## Final thoughts

Wordbender isn't perfect, and it definitely doesn't replace traditional wordlists entirely. But as a supplement to existing techniques, it's proven useful enough that I'll continue building it.

As always, I'm open to feedback, questions, and pull requests.
